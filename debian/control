Description: open scientific computation platform
 OpenAxiom is an open source platform for symbolic, algebraic, and numerical
 computations. It offers an interactive environment, an expressive programming
 language, a compiler, a large set of mathematical libraries of interest to
 researchers and practitioners of computational sciences.
