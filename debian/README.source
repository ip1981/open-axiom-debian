There is a target in "debian/rules" to fetch original
source tarball for OpenAxiom: get-orig-source.

It fetches sources from SVN repository on SourceForge,
the SVN revision should be specified in version in "debian/changelog".


For the first release (1.4.1+svn~2299+ds-1) these files are removed
from original tarball (that's why +ds):

./contrib (due to lisences mess)
./src/include/xpm.h (system header is used;
                  this file will be removed in upstream too)
