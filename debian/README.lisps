Lisps to build OpenAxiom:
SBCL, GCL, CLisp, ECL, CCL

SBCL is preferable, then GCL, then CLisp and so on.

As of Wheezy, SBCL is present only for:
i386, amd64, kfreebsd-amd64.

On other arch GCL should be used.
To build with GCL libncurses-dev and libreadline-dev are required.
If changing lisp remember to edit debian/control, debian/rules and this file.
